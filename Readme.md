## 1. Project Title
Self-Sovereign Academic Identity Wallet (SSAIW)

## 2. Project Description
The **Self-Sovereign Academic Identity Wallet** is a Clarity smart contract that enables students to store and control their verified academic credentials on the blockchain.  
Instead of relying on centralized institutions for record verification, students can present verifiable on-chain proof of their educational achievements anytime, anywhere.

## 3. Project Vision
Our vision is to empower students with **complete ownership of their academic identity**, enabling them to securely share their verified records with employers, universities, or other institutions without intermediaries.

## 4. Future Scope
- Add **multi-institution verification** for added trust.
- Integrate with **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** for cross-platform use.
- Enable **NFT-based academic certificates** for easy transfer and display.
- Add **privacy-preserving ZK proofs** so students can prove qualifications without revealing all details.
- Build a **front-end DApp** for easy interaction.

## 5. Contract Address
(To be deployed â€” address will be added after deployment on Stacks blockchain)
